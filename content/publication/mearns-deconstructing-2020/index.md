abstract: Animal behavior often forms sequences, built from simple stereotyped actions
  and shaped by environmental cues. A comprehensive characterization of the interplay
  between an animal’s movements and its environment is necessary to understand the
  sensorimotor transformations performed by the brain. Here, we use unsupervised methods
  to study behavioral sequences in zebraﬁsh larvae. We generate a map of swim bouts,
  revealing that ﬁsh modulate their tail movements along a continuum. During prey
  capture, larvae produce stereotyped sequences using a subset of bouts from a broader
  behavioral repertoire. These sequences exhibit loworder transition dynamics and
  immediately respond to changes in visual cues. Chaining of prey capture bouts is
  disrupted in visually impaired (lakritz and blumenkohl) mutants, and removing the
  prey stimulus during ongoing behavior in closed-loop virtual reality causes larvae
  to immediately abort the hunting sequence. These results suggest that the continuous
  integration of sensory information is necessary to structure the behavior. This
  stimulus-response loop serves to bring prey into the anterior dorsal visual ﬁeld
  of the larvae. Fish then release a capture strike maneuver comprising a stereotyped
  jaw movement and tail movements ﬁne-tuned to the distance of the prey. Fish with
  only one intact eye fail to correctly position the prey in the strike zone, but
  are able to produce the strike itself. Our analysis shows that short-term integration
  of binocular visual cues shapes the behavioral dynamics of hunting, thus uncovering
  the temporal organization of a goal-directed behavior in a vertebrate.
