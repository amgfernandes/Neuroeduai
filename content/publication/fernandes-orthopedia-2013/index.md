abstract: The homeodomain transcription factor Orthopedia (Otp) is an important regulator
  for specification of defined subsets of neuroendocrine cells and dopaminergic neurons
  in vertebrates. In zebrafish, two paralogous otp genes, otpa and otpb, are present
  in the genome. Neither complete loss of Otp activity nor differential contributions
  of Otpa and Otpb to specification of defined neuronal populations have been analyzed
  in detail. We characterized zebrafish embryos and early larvae mutant for null alleles
  of otpa, otpb, or both genes to determine their individual contributions to the
  specification of th expressing dopaminergic neuronal populations as well as of crh,
  oxt, avp, trh or sst1.1 expressing neuroendocrine cells. otpa mutant larvae show
  an almost complete reduction of ventral diencephalic dopaminergic neurons, as reported
  previously. A small reduction in the number of trh cells in the preoptic region
  is detectable in otpa mutants, but no significant loss of crh, oxt and avp preoptic
  neuroendocrine cells. otpb single mutant larvae do not display a reduction in dopaminergic
  neurons or neuroendocrine cells in the otp expressing regions. In contrast, in otpa
  and otpb double mutant larvae specific groups of dopaminergic neurons as well as
  of crh, oxt, avp, trh and sst1.1-expressing neuroendocrine cells are completely
  lost. These observations suggest that the requirement for otpa and otpb function
  during development of the larval diencephalon is partially redundant. During evolutionary
  diversification of the paralogous otp genes, otpa maintained the prominent role
  in ventral diencephalic dopaminergic and neuroendocrine cell specification and is
  capable of partially compensating otpb loss of function. In addition, we identified
  a role of Otp in the development of a domain of somatostatin1-expressing cells in
  the rostral hindbrain, a region with strong otp expression but so far uncharacterized
  Otp function. Otp may thus be crucial for defined neuronal cell types also in the
  hindbrain.
