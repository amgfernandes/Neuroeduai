abstract: Most vertebrates process visual information using elaborately structured
  photosensory tissues, including the eyes and pineal. However, there is strong evidence
  that other tissues can detect and respond to photic stimuli [1–3]. Many reports
  suggest that photosensitive elements exist within the brain itself and inﬂuence
  physiology and behavior; however, a long-standing puzzle has been the identity of
  the neurons and photoreceptor molecules involved [4, 5]. We tested whether light
  cues inﬂuence behavior in zebraﬁsh larvae through deep brain photosensors. We found
  that larvae lacking eyes and pineal perform a simple light-seeking behavior triggered
  by loss of illumination (‘‘dark photokinesis’’). Neuroanatomical considerations
  prompted us to test orthopedia (otpa)-deﬁcient ﬁsh, which show a profound reduction
  in dark photokinesis. Using targeted genetic ablations, we narrowed the photosensitive
  region to neurons in the preoptic area. Neurons in this region express several photoreceptive
  molecules, but expression of the melanopsin opn4a is selectively lost in otpa mutants,
  suggesting that opn4a mediates dark photokinesis. Our ﬁndings shed light on the
  identity and function of deep brain photoreceptors and suggest that otpa speciﬁes
  an ancient population of sensory neurons that mediate behavioral responses to light.
