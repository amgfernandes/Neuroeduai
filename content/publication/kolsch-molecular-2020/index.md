abstract: Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) form an array of feature detectors, which
  convey visual information to central brain regions. Characterizing RGC diversity
  is required to understand the logic of the underlying functional segregation. Using
  single-cell transcriptomics, we systematically classified RGCs in adult and larval
  zebrafish, thereby identifying marker genes for textgreater30 mature types and several
  developmental intermediates. We used this dataset to engineer transgenic driver
  lines, enabling specific experimental access to a subset of RGC types. Expression
  of one or few transcription factors often predicts dendrite morphologies and axonal
  projections to specific tectal layers and extratectal targets. In vivo calcium imaging
  revealed that molecularly defined RGCs exhibit specific functional tuning. Finally,
  chemogenetic ablation of eomesa+ RGCs, which comprise melanopsin-expressing types
  with projections to a small subset of central targets, selectively impaired phototaxis.
  Together, our study establishes a framework for systematically studying the functional
  architecture of the visual system.
