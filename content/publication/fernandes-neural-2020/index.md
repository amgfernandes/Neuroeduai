abstract: When navigating the environment, animals need to prioritize responses to
  the most relevant stimuli. Although a theoretical framework for selective visual
  attention exists, its circuit implementation has remained obscure. Here we investigated
  how larval zebrafish select between simultaneously presented visual stimuli. We
  found that a mix of winner-take-all (WTA) and averaging strategies best simulates
  behavioral responses. We identified two circuits whose activity patterns predict
  the relative saliencies of competing visual objects. Stimuli presented to only one
  eye are selected by WTA computation in the inner retina. Binocularly presented stimuli,
  on the other hand, are processed by reciprocal, bilateral connections between the
  nucleus isthmi (NI) and the tectum. This interhemispheric computation leads to WTA
  or averaging responses. Optogenetic stimulation and laser ablation of NI neurons
  disrupt stimulus selection and behavioral action selection. Thus, depending on the
  relative locations of competing stimuli, a combination of retinotectal and isthmotectal
  circuits enables selective visual attention.
