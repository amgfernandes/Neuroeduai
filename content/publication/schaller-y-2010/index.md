abstract: The male-specific regions of the Y chromosome (MSY) of the human and the
  chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) are fully sequenced. The most striking difference is
  the dramatic rearrangement of large parts of their respective MSYs. These nonrecombining
  regions include ampliconic gene families that are known to be important for male
  reproduction,and are consequently under significant selective pressure. However,
  whether the published Y-chromosomal pattern of ampliconic fertility genes is invariable
  within P. troglodytes is an open but fundamental question pertinent to discussions
  of the evolutionary fate of the Y chromosome in different primate mating systems.
  To solve this question we applied fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) of testis-specific
  expressed ampliconic fertility genes to metaphase Y chromosomes of 17 chimpanzees
  derived from 11 wild-born males and 16 bonobos representing seven wild-born males.
  We show that of eleven P. troglodytes Y-chromosomal lines, ten Y-chromosomal variants
  were detected based on the number and arrangement of the ampliconic fertility genes
  DAZ (deleted in azoospermia) and CDY (chromodomain protein Y)—a so-far never-described
  variation of a species’ Y chromosome. In marked contrast, no variation was evident
  among seven Ychromosomal lines of the bonobo, P. paniscus, the chimpanzee’s closest
  living relative. Although, loss of variation of the Y chromosome in the bonobo by
  a founder effect or genetic drift cannot be excluded, these contrasting patterns
  might be explained in the context of the species’ markedly different social and
  mating behaviour. In chimpanzees, multiple males copulate with a receptive female
  during a short period of visible anogenital swelling, and this may place significant
  selection on fertility genes. In bonobos, however, female mate choice may make sperm
  competition redundant (leading to monomorphism of fertility genes), since ovulation
  in this species is concealed by the prolonged anogenital swelling, and because female
  bonobos can occupy high-ranking positions in the group and are thus able to determine
  mate choice more freely.
