abstract: Understanding brain-wide neuronal dynamics requires a detailed map of the
  underlying circuit architecture. We built an interactive cellular-resolution atlas
  of the zebraﬁsh brain at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) based on the reconstructions
  of over 2,000 individually GFP-labeled neurons. We clustered our dataset in ‘‘morphotypes,’’
  establishing a unique database of quantitatively described neuronal morphologies
  together with their spatial coordinates in vivo. Over 100 transgene expression patterns
  were imaged separately and co-registered with the single-neuron atlas. By annotating
  72 non-overlapping brain regions, we generated from our dataset an inter-areal wiring
  diagram of the larval brain, which serves as ground truth for synapse-scale, electron
  microscopic reconstructions. Interrogating our atlas by ‘‘virtual tract tracing’’
  has already revealed previously unknown wiring principles in the tectum and the
  cerebellum. In conclusion, we present here an evolving computational resource and
  visualization tool, which will be essential to map function to structure in a vertebrate
  brain.
