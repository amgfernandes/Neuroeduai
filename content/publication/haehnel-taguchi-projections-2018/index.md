abstract: Dopaminergic neurons of the descending diencephalospinal system are located
  in the posterior tuberculum (PT) in zebraﬁsh (Danio rerio), and correspond in mammals
  to the A11 group in hypothalamus and thalamus. In the larval zebraﬁsh, they are
  likely the only source of central dopaminergic projections to the periphery. Here,
  we characterized posterior tubercular dopaminergic ﬁbers projecting to peripheral
  sense organs, with a focus on the lateral line neuromasts. We labeled and identiﬁed
  catecholaminergic neurons and their projections by combining two immunoﬂuorescence
  techniques, (i) using an antibody against Tyrosine hydroxylase, and (ii) using an
  antibody against GFP in transgenic zebraﬁsh expressing in catecholaminergic neurons
  either membrane-anchored GFP to track ﬁbers, or a Synaptophysin-GFP fusion to visualize
  putative synapses. We applied the CLARITY method to 6 days old whole zebraﬁsh larvae
  to stain and analyze dopaminergic projections by confocal microscopy. We found that
  all lateral line neuromasts receive direct innervation by posterior tubercular dopaminergic
  neurons, and tracked these projections in detail. In addition, we found dopaminergic
  ﬁbers projecting to the anterior and posterior lateral line ganglia, and extensive
  central dopaminergic arborizations around the terminal projection ﬁeld of the lateral
  line afferent neurons in the hindbrain medial octavolateralis nucleus (MON). Therefore,
  dopaminergic innervation may affect lateral line sense information at different
  processing stages. Additional dopaminergic ﬁbers innervate the trigeminal ganglion,
  and we observed ﬁne catecholaminergic ﬁbers in the skin with arborization patterns
  similar to free sensory nerve endings. We also detected potentially dopaminergic
  ﬁbers innervating inner ear sensory epithelia. Therefore, the diencephalospinal
  A11-type dopaminergic system may broadly modulate peripheral senses. We also brieﬂy
  report peripheral sympathetic catecholaminergic projections labeled in our experiments,
  and their innervation of the developing intestine, swim bladder and abdominal organs.
