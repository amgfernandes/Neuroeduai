<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, fascinated by the analysis of data to extract valuable insights and create knowledge. I believe that knowledge and education empower people and improve our world.
I am an experienced Neuroscientist using machine learning methods for the analysis of big data.
I love teaching and to work in a team to solve complex questions.</p>
